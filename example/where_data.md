#How I got the data for my simulation

For the wind speed data source I used the output of the FAST simulation.  See the
file Test13.out.

For the audio data, I hacked together a Python script to generate obviously good
and obviously bad sample data.  Try running generate_audio_data.py to see how
it works.
